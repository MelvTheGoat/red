            Dear Bears,<br />Thank you so much for letting me stay at your house
            recently.<br />
            I had a wonderful time and you were very kind to me.<br />However, I
            am sorry that I ate Little Bear's porridge, broke his<br />chair and
            fell asleep in his bed.didn't mean to make him<br />upset and cry. I
            hope he is feeling better about things now. I<br />would love to
            come and stay with you again soon. <br />Best wishes,
          </p>
